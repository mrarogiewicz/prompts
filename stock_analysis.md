# [Global AI Directive: Deep Research Mandate]
# **Primary Instruction:** Your most important directive is to conduct deep, thorough, and comprehensive research for every section of this report. Prioritize the quality, accuracy, and depth of your analysis over the speed of your response. This is not a time-sensitive task.

# **Methodology:**
# - **Think Step-by-Step:** Before writing each section, take the time to synthesize information from all available sources. Do not rely on superficial summaries. Dig into the details of financial filings (10-Ks, 10-Qs), investor presentations, and reputable financial news.
# - **Connect the Dots:** Your analysis must be integrated. Actively look for connections between different parts of the report. For instance, when analyzing cash flow, explain how management's capital allocation decisions (Section 12) have impacted it. When discussing the moat (Section 4), link it to the company's profitability trends (Section 9).
# - **Comprehensive Search:** Assume that the initial search results may not be sufficient. Perform follow-up searches to find specific metrics, management quotes, or market data needed to build a strong, evidence-based argument.

# **Expected Output:**
# The final report should reflect a thoughtful, well-researched, and analytical mindset. The goal is to produce an institutional-grade analysis that is insightful and data-driven, not a quick, surface-level summary. Treat this as a complex research project.```
