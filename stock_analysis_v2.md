# [Core Directives and Rules]
## Part A: Sourcing & Citation Rules

  - **X:** Focus on posts #[TICKER] hashtag.
- **Citations:**
  - Identify the 5 most critical factual claims supporting your thesis and cite them in-line: `(Source: Name of Source, Date)`.

- **Data Freshness:** At the end of the report, include a “Sources & Data Freshness” list.
### Part B: Formatting & General Rules
  - **Numbers & Derivations:** Do not invent or guess numbers.

If a required input is missing on Yahoo, write "Not Available" — do not substitute other numeric sources without explicit user approval.
  - **Labeling:** Clearly distinguish between verified financial data from Yahoo Finance and subjective sentiment. Label any user-provided data as "User-Provided Data."
  - **Currency:** Use the [REPORT_CURRENCY] for all financial tables, stating it clearly in each header (e.g., "All figures in USD Millions").
  - **Formatting:** Use standard suffixes for currency ($10.5B, €410M) and one decimal place for percentages (12.3%).
  - **Period Labeling:** Use actual report end-dates (e.g., "Quarter Ended 2025-06-30"). Add a footnote if a major event affects comparability between periods.
  - **Data Gaps:** If a required metric is unavailable on Yahoo Finance, explicitly state "Not Available" and briefly explain why (e.g., "Company does not disclose this metric" or "Metric not applicable").
  - **Citations & Dates:** Use this inline format for numeric claims: `(Source: Yahoo Finance, YYYY-MM-DD)`. For qualitative claims cite primary doc: `(Source: 10-K, YYYY-MM-DD)` or `(Source: Company IR deck, YYYY-MM-DD)`. Set `[AS_OF_DATE]` as `YYYY-MM-DD` and state it at the top of the report.
